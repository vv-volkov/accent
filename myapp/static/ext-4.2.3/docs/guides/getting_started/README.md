# Getting Started

This guide helps you set up a development environment with all the required 
software tools you need to create and debug Ext JS applications. This guide
also explains the layout and directory contents of a standard application, 
and walks you through the creation of a simple application.

## Get Ext JS 4 SDK

Download [Ext JS 4 SDK](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/). Unzip the package 
into a new directory of your choosing. Because you may also be 
creating Touch applications 
as well, it's a good idea to place all available SDKs and their versions in a single 
directory for easy reference whenever you wish to create a new 
application (or upgrade older ones). 
In this case, an appropriate directory in which to place your SDKs can be called 
<code>SenchaSdk</code>, or any name you choose. 
The directory where you unzip Ext JS is the "<i>/path/to/extjs</i>" directory, which 
appears in the examples in this guide.

## Get a Web Browser

Ext JS 4 supports all major web browsers, from Internet Explorer 6 to the 
latest version of Google Chrome. During development, however, we recommend 
that you choose the latest version of the following browsers for the best debugging experience:

- [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) 
- [Apple Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/download/) 
- [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/fx/) with the [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/) web development plugin

This tutorial assumes you are using the latest version of Google Chrome. 
If you don't already have Chrome take a moment to install it, and familiarize 
yourself with the 
[Chrome Developer Tools](http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/overview.html).

## Get Sencha Cmd

<a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/download">Sencha Cmd</a>
is a free tool with many useful functions. You can generate a starting environment, 
"stub" applications, update your software, update files, and it also provides a 
simplified web server. In addition, Sencha Cmd supports Ant commands 
that let you customize build tools.

After you download and install Sencha Cmd, you can verify that it's working by 
typing the <b>sencha</b> command in a command line prompt. The output appears as:

<pre>
$ sencha
<b>Sencha Cmd vn.n.n.n</b>
Sencha Cmd provides several categories of commands and some global switches. 
...
</pre>

## Sencha Cmd Web Server

Sencha Cmd provides a simplified Jetty web server for use in serving your application
to your web browser. You can run the web server from a command line using the 
the <b>sencha web start</b> command.

You can set the port with the <code>-port</code> option. The
<code>-map</code> parameter specifies the path to the directory you want to serve.

By default, the server is accessed using the
<a href="http://localhost:1841">http://localhost:1841</a> URL in your browser.
The directory used for the root of the web server is the directory in which you issue
the <b>sencha web start</b> command.

The web server runs in the window until you press CTRL+c or open 
another command prompt and type the <b>sencha web stop</b> command. 

After completing the tutorial in this guide, you may want to use 
a more sophisticated web server such as the Apache HTTP web server. You 
can obtain a pre-configured Apache web server
using <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP</a>. 
Information on starting and stopping that web server, and where 
to put files that you access with the web server is
available at the XAMPP site.

## Creating an Application

After you install Ext JS, you can use the Sencha Cmd <code>generate</code> command to 
create the starting directory structure for your application. 

To create the "Hello Ext" application:

<ol>
<li><p>Choose or create a directory where your application will reside, 
change to that directory and issue the following command:</p>
<pre>
$ sencha -sdk <i>/path/to/extjs</i> generate app <i>MyApp</i> .
</pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>/path/to/extjs</i> is the directory where you unzipped the Ext JS software.</li>
<li><i>MyApp</i> is the name you give your application.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Now you're ready to write your application code. Open the 
<code>Application.js</code> file in the <code>app</code> directory, 
delete what's there, and insert the following code:</p>
<pre>
Ext.define('MyApp.Application', {
    name: 'MyApp',
    extend: 'Ext.app.Application',
    launch: function() {
        Ext.create('Ext.container.Viewport', {
            layout: 'fit',
            items: [
                {
                    title: 'Hello Ext',
                    html : 'Hello! Welcome to Ext JS.'
                }
            ]
        });
    }
});
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>We can now start up the Sencha web server to view our
application in a browser. If you have not already done so, open a command line
prompt and change directory to your <code>MyApp</code> directory.
Start the Sencha Cmd web server using the 
<b>sencha&nbsp;web&nbsp;start</b> command. 
These messages display:</p>
<pre>
$ <b>sencha web start</b>
Sencha Cmd vn.n.n.n
[INF] Starting shutdown listener socket
[INF] Listening for stop requests on: 62249
[INF] Mapping http://localhost:1841/ to ....

[INF] started o.e.j.w.WebAppContext{/,file:/Users/me/Documents/MyApp/}
[INF] Started SelectChannelConnector@0.0.0.0:1841
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>Open your browser and navigate to 
<a href="http://localhost:1841/">http://localhost:1841/</a>.
You should see a panel with a title bar containing the text "Hello Ext" 
and the "welcome" message in the panel's body area:</p>
{@img WelcomeToExtJS.png}
</li>
</ol>
<p>Success! You have created your first Ext JS application.</p>

## Behind the Scenes

Now that you've created your first application, let's look at what happened
as each step unfolded.

<ol>
<li><p>When you ran <b>sencha generate app</b>, Sencha Cmd 
created this list of files:</p>
<pre>
MyApp:
    .sencha    [Files used by Sencha CMD]
    app:       [Contains your application source]
        <b>Application.js</b> -- [The starting point of your app]
        controller:
            Main.js
            Readme.md
        model:
            Readme.md
        Readme.md
        store:
            Readme.md
        view:
            Main.js
            Readme.md
            Viewport.js
    app.js
    app.json
    bootstrap.css
    bootstrap.js
    bootstrap.json
    build:    [Where your testing, production, and native builds are generated]
        temp:
            production:
                MyApp:
                    sencha-compiler:
                        app:
                            full-page-master-bundle.js
                        cmd-packages.js
    build.xml
    ext: [Ext JS framework - do not modify]
        bootstrap.js
        build.xml
        builds:
            ext-*.js [Debugging files]
        cmd:
        ext-*.js [Debug and themes files]
        ext.js
        file-header.js
        license.txt
        locale:
            [Language source files]
        packages:
            [Locale &amp; themes directories]
        src:
            [Source files]
    index.html
    overrides: [Empty]
    packages: [Empty]
    Readme.md
    resources: [Empty]
    sass:
        config.rb
        etc: [Empty]
        example:
            bootstrap.css
            custom.js
            render.js
            theme.html
        src: [Empty]
        var: [Empty]
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>When you point your browser to the application directory, 
the browser opens your <code>index.html</code> file, 
loads the core Ext JS stylesheet, framework, and 
bootstrap code along with the <code>app.js</code> file. 
The <code>app.js</code> file contains the <code>Ext.application</code> class, 
which is the starting point for all applications. Because Sencha Cmd uses 
the <code>index.html</code> file to build production versions and 
because the generated content of this file is critical to the proper 
functioning of your application, do not edit this file.</p>

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML>
&lt;html>
&lt;head>
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8">
    &lt;title>MyApp&lt;/title>
    &lt;!-- &lt;x-compile> -->
        &lt;!-- &lt;x-bootstrap> -->
            &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap.css">
            &lt;script src="ext/ext-dev.js">&lt;/script>
            &lt;script src="bootstrap.js">&lt;/script>
        &lt;!-- &lt;/x-bootstrap> -->
        &lt;script src="app.js">&lt;/script>
    &lt;!-- &lt;/x-compile> -->
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>&lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</pre></li>
<li><p>The other important file generated by Sencha Cmd is <code>app.js</code>, 
the contents of which are shown here:</p>
<pre>
Ext.application({
    name: 'MyApp',
    extend: 'MyApp.Application',    
    autoCreateViewport: true
});
</pre></li>
<li><p>As with the <code>index.html</code> file, 
do not modify the generated 
<code>app.js</code> file.</p> 

<p>Put your code in 
the <code>Application.js</code> file, in the <code>app/</code> 
directory. This is where you place your application’s startup 
code, including a <code>launch</code> method, which contains 
any code required to be run during the startup of your application.</p>
<p>In our code example, the <code>launch</code> function creates 
the application’s initial viewport, which is a simple panel with 
a title and content:</p>
<pre>
Ext.define('MyApp.Application', {
    name: 'MyApp',
    extend: 'Ext.app.Application',
    launch: function() {
        Ext.create('Ext.container.Viewport', {
            layout: 'fit',
            items: [
                {
                    title: 'Hello Ext',
                    html : 'Hello! Welcome to Ext JS.'
                }
            ]
        });
    }
});
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
